## Location & travel

The meeting will be held at the Departament d'Astronomia i Astrofísica (DAA) of the Universitat de València (UV). The DAA is located in the Campus of Sciences (Campus de Burjassot) of the UV, in the town of Burjassot, next to the city of Valencia. In particular, the DAA is in the fourth floor of a round and white building, very visible from almost everywhere in the Campus, whose address is the following:

Edificio de Investigación Jeroni Muñoz
Dr Moliner, 50 Burjassot 46100
Valencia (SPAIN)

Here you have a [Google Maps link to the location of the DAA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LDDR9VMe9BjWaCXMA).

In particular, we will meet at the **Aula d'Astronomia**. To reach the Aula d'Astronomia, enter the building and go to south wing of the building. Then, go the fifth floor *(caution! the operation is not commutative; the Aula d'Astronomia can only be reached through these stairs/lift)*.

### How to get to the DAA your hotel

From the Hotel Port Fira, you can reach the department by a 15-minute walk.

### How to get to the DAA from the city centre

#### By tramway or metro

The best option to arrive to the DAA is by Tramway Line 4 (blue line). This tramline has several destinations you will see at the front of the trams: “Ll. Llarga/Terramelar”, “Mas del Rosari”, "Fira", and “Vicent Andrés Estellés”. In any of these destinations you have to get off at “Vicente Andrés Estellés”, where you will be just in front of the white building in which the DAA is located. The pass frequency is at worst ten minutes.

Depending on the part of the city you are, it might not be possible to find a near tramway stop. You can use however any of the Metro lines to connect with the tramway line (the same ticket works for both, metro and tramway). In the case you need to take a Metro line, the best option for connection with tram is taking Lines 1 and 2 (yellow/pink lines) in direction "Lliria / Bétera / Seminari CEU". Any of the trains in this line (with destinations "Lliria", "Paterna", "Seminari" or "Bétera") will stop at "Empalme", where you can change to the tram. The main stop for connection between the rest of Metro lines and Lines 1/2 is "Àngel Guimerà".

You can check the [schedules](https://www.metrovalencia.es/es/consulta-de-horarios-y-planificador/) and the [metro map](https://www.metrovalencia.es/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Plano-general-Metrovalencia-2023.pdf), or you can look up for directions in [Google Maps](https://www.google.es/maps). The cost of the single ride is 1.5€ («Zona A»), but you can buy and recharge a TuiN card at any ticket machine and you will pay 0.80€ per trip.

#### By bus

Alternatively, another convenient way to arrive to the Campus of Sciences is the EMT Bus. Take line 63 (to “Campus Burjassot UV”), and stop at “Campus Burjassot”. Pass frequency is around 15 minutes, but only from Monday to Friday. This bus line connects the Train Station ("Estación del Norte-RENFE") with the Campus. However, there are several bus stops along its way. The cost of the ride is 1.5€ and it takes about 15-20 minutes. With the current discounts, you can buy a ticket for 10 rides («bonobús») for 4.25€. You can find more information in the [EMT website](https://geoportal.emtvalencia.es/visor?lang=es).

### Conference dinner 

The conference dinner will be held at the Delgadito Gastrobar (Carrer de Sant Antoni, 5, Godella 46110). You can find the location through this [Google Maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wnbwJkMdTZDAZ3Tt8?g_st=iw). From the DAA, you can reach the restaurant by a 20-minute walk. Alternatively (although it will likely be slower), you can take the tramway to "Empalme", and then change to the metro (line 1, destination "Seminari-CEU" or "Bétera") and get off at "Godella". The restaurant is located at 1 minute walking from the metro stop.
