## What is ASOHF?

ASOHF is an Adaptive Spherical Overdensity Halo Finder, primarily designed to identify bound dark matter structures (dark matter haloes), as well as their stellar counterparts (galaxies) in the outputs of cosmological simulations.

While ASOHF was original envisioned to work coupled to the outputs of the [MASCLET code](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/352/4/1426/1077772), it is nowadays a fully standalone tools, which works directly on an input particle list.

See the code repository for downloading the code:

### What is in these pages?

These pages contain the documentation of the code, including the input/output formats and a description on the parameters that can be tuned to run ASOHF. For the scientific description of the code, please refer to the code papers (see below, in [Referencing ASOHF](#referencing-asohf))

## About

ASOHF has been developed at the Computational Cosmology Group of [Universitat de València](https://www.uv.es), with financial support from the Spanish [Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación](https://www.ciencia.gob.es/), via the project "Real and virtual galaxies: Simulations" (PID2019-107427GB-C33); and by Generalitat Valenciana [Conselleria d'Innovació, Universitats, Ciència i Societat Digital](https://innova.gva.es/es/web/ciencia), through the project "Relativistic Astrophysics, Computational Cosmology and Gravitational Wave Astronomy" (PROMETEO/2019/071).

### Disclaimer

ASOHF and all its associated codes are a non-profit, open source tool developed in the context of a research project. While we share it in the hope that it will be useful, it comes without any guarantee to function. Please, be sure to always check the consistency of your results.
