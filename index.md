### Announcement

Welcome to the “FOGLESS 2024 meeting” to be held in Valencia (Spain) from XXX to YYY 2024.

The project began in 2023 and, As you all know, it is formed by three main scientific nodes: US (PI: José Oñorbe), UCM (PI: Patricia Sánchez-Blázquez) and UV (PIs: Susana Planelles, Vicent Quilis).
This will be the first meeting of our coordinated project, which will be useful in order to meet everybody and get informed about what each one of us is working on.

The program will be very informal. We will have short sessions of selected talks on XXX, and YYY.
