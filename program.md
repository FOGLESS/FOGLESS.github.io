## Program of the meeting

The meeting will take place on Tuesday 13 and Wednesday 14 May and will provide an opportunity to present our work in short talks of around 12 minutes plus 3 minutes for questions, as well as a place for discussion and breaks to catch up catch with each other.

We will have all our sessions at the **Aula d'Astronomia**. To reach the Aula d'Astronomia, enter the building and go to the south wing of the building. Then, go to the fifth floor *(caution! the operation is not commutative; the Aula d'Astronomia can only be reached through these stairs/lift)*.
